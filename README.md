# DriveMind

**Collective Memory and Intent Prediction System for Intelligent Vehicles**

DriveMind is an AI-powered intelligent vehicle system that allows vehicles to learn from driving experiences and share useful safety knowledge with other vehicles.

Instead of sharing raw sensor data, DriveMind stores and shares structured driving experiences such as risky turns, sudden braking events, low visibility zones, and near-miss situations.

The project combines:

- Vehicle telemetry simulation
- AI-based driver/vehicle intent prediction
- Risk scoring
- Collective experience memory
- Real-time alerts
- Graph-based road knowledge using Neo4j
- React dashboard for visualization

---

## Project Goal

Modern intelligent vehicles usually make decisions using only their own sensors and local environment.

DriveMind extends this idea by giving vehicles a form of collective memory.

When one vehicle experiences a dangerous situation on a road segment, that experience is stored and can help future vehicles understand risk before they reach the same location.

---

## Key Idea

DriveMind does not simply store raw vehicle data.

It converts driving situations into structured experience memory.

Example:

```json
{
  "vehicleId": "vehicle_01",
  "roadSegmentId": "curve_42",
  "eventType": "high_risk_driving",
  "reason": "sudden_braking, sharp_turn_risk, near_miss, bad_weather",
  "riskScore": 0.9,
  "recommendedAction": "Immediate braking or avoidance required"
}
```

This experience becomes part of a shared memory system that other vehicles can use.

---

## Features

### 1. Vehicle Telemetry Ingestion

The backend accepts vehicle telemetry such as:

- Vehicle ID
- Road segment ID
- Speed
- Acceleration
- Brake pressure
- Steering angle
- Lane offset
- Distance from front vehicle
- Weather condition

---

### 2. AI Intent Prediction

The AI service predicts the likely intent of the vehicle using telemetry input.

Possible predictions include:

- Keep lane
- Brake
- Turn
- Change lane

The current model is trained on synthetic simulation data for MVP demonstration.

> Note: The current AI model is a prototype trained on synthetic data. It is not claimed to represent real-world vehicle performance. Future versions can use CARLA simulation or real-world trajectory datasets.

---

### 3. Risk Scoring Engine

The backend calculates a driving risk score based on vehicle behavior and environment.

Risk factors include:

- High speed
- Sudden braking
- Sharp steering
- Close following distance
- Rain or fog
- Low visibility

Risk levels:

- Low
- Medium
- High
- Critical

---

### 4. Collective Experience Memory

If a risky situation is detected, DriveMind stores it as an experience.

Each experience includes:

- Vehicle involved
- Road segment
- Weather
- Event type
- Risk score
- Recommended action
- Reason for risk

---

### 5. Real-Time Risk Alerts

DriveMind uses Socket.IO to send real-time alerts to the dashboard when a high-risk event is detected.

This allows the frontend to immediately show alerts without refreshing the page.

---

### 6. Neo4j Graph Memory

DriveMind stores road experiences as graph relationships.

Example graph structure:

```text
Vehicle → EXPERIENCED → Experience
Experience → AT → RoadSegment
Experience → DURING → Weather
Experience → TYPE → Event
Experience → SUGGESTS → Action
```

This makes it possible to analyze relationships between vehicles, roads, weather, and driving risks.

---

### 7. React Dashboard

The frontend dashboard displays:

- Backend health status
- Road risk summary
- Total stored experiences
- Latest real-time alert
- Collective memory graph overview
- Experience memory records
- Button to simulate risky vehicle telemetry

---

```

Run:

```cypher
MATCH (n)-[r]->(m)
RETURN n, r, m
LIMIT 50;
```

This shows the collective vehicle memory graph.

---

## Example Graph Memory

A risky event creates graph relationships like:

```text
(vehicle_graph_01)-[:EXPERIENCED]->(Experience)
(Experience)-[:AT]->(curve_42)
(Experience)-[:DURING]->(rain)
(Experience)-[:TYPE]->(high_risk_driving)
(Experience)-[:SUGGESTS]->(Immediate braking or avoidance required)
```

---

## Real-Time Events

DriveMind uses Socket.IO for real-time updates.

### Event Name

```text
risk-alert
```

### Example Payload

```json
{
  "vehicleId": "vehicle_graph_01",
  "roadSegmentId": "curve_42",
  "riskScore": 0.9,
  "riskLevel": "critical",
  "recommendedAction": "Immediate braking or avoidance required"
}
```

---

## Machine Learning Model

The AI model is a Random Forest classifier.

Input features:

- Speed
- Acceleration
- Brake pressure
- Steering angle
- Lane offset
- Distance to front vehicle

Output:

- Predicted vehicle intent

Current intent labels:

- keep_lane
- brake
- turn
- change_lane

The model is trained on synthetic data generated inside the project.

Current training accuracy during testing:

```text
0.9840
```

This accuracy is only for synthetic test data and should not be treated as real-world performance.

## Roadmap

The full project roadmap is available here:

---

## Why This Project Is Useful

DriveMind demonstrates how intelligent vehicles can move beyond isolated decision-making.

Instead of each vehicle learning alone, vehicles can contribute to a shared memory system.

This can help future vehicles:

- Slow down before dangerous turns
- Avoid high-risk road segments
- React better during rain or fog
- Learn from previous near-miss events
- Improve safety using shared experience

---

## Hackathon Value

DriveMind is useful as a hackathon project because it combines multiple strong technical areas:

- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning
- Intelligent Vehicles
- Backend Engineering
- Real-time Systems
- Graph Databases
- Full-stack Development
- Docker-based infrastructure

It is not just a normal dashboard project. It shows a complete intelligent system pipeline from telemetry input to AI prediction, risk analysis, memory storage, graph reasoning, and real-time visualization.
